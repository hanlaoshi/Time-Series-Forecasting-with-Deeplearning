- Multivariate Time Series Prediction Based on Temporal Change Information Learning Method    [[Paper]](https://github.com/hanlaoshi/Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Deeplearning/blob/main/PDF%20files%20repo/Multivariate_Time_Series_Prediction_Based_on_Temporal_Change_Information_Learning_Method.pdf)

         A temporal change information learning (CIL) method is proposed in this article.

- Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Latent Graph Inference   [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03423)

        This paper introduces a new approach for Multivariate Time Series forecasting that jointly infers and leverages relations among time series.

- Autoformer: Decomposition Transformers with Auto-Correlation for Long-Term Series Forecasting   [[Paper]](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/bcc0d400288793e8bdcd7c19a8ac0c2b-Abstract.html)  [[Code]](https://github.com/hanlaoshi/Autoformer)

        This paper design Autoformer as a novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. The paper break with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a basic inner block of deep models.

- N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437) [[Code]](https://github.com/unit8co/darts)   [[Dataset Used1]](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/m4)  [[Dataset Used2]](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/timehetnet) 

        This paper propose a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully-connected layers.

- Modeling Long- and Short-Term Temporal Patterns with Deep Neural Networks. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07015) [[Code]](https://github.com/laiguokun/LSTNet)

         In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet), to address this open challenge.
