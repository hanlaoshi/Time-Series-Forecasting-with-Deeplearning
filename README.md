- Pyraformer: Low-Complexity Pyramidal Attention for Long-Range Time Series Modeling and Forecasting. [[paper]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=0EXmFzUn5I) [[code]](https://github.com/alipay/Pyraformer)

         In this paper, These authors propose Pyraformer by exploring the multiresolution representation of the time series.

- Multivariate Time Series Prediction Based on Temporal Change Information Learning Method    [[Paper]](https://github.com/hanlaoshi/Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Deeplearning/blob/main/PDF%20files%20repo/Multivariate_Time_Series_Prediction_Based_on_Temporal_Change_Information_Learning_Method.pdf)

         A temporal change information learning (CIL) method is proposed in this article.

- Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Latent Graph Inference   [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03423)

        This paper introduces a new approach for Multivariate Time Series forecasting that jointly infers and leverages relations among time series.

- Transformers in Time Series: A Survey. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07125) 

         In this paper, these authors systematically review transformer schemes for time series modeling by highlighting their strengths as well as limitations through a new taxonomy to summarize existing time series transformers in two perspectives. 
         
- Bayesian optimization based dynamic ensemble for time series forecasting. [[Paper]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025522000135)

         This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization-based dynamic ensemble (BODE) that overcomes the single model-based methods limitation and provides a dynamic ensemble forecast combination for TS with time-varying underlying patterns.

- Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting with Shape and Temporal Diversity. [[Paper]](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/2f2b265625d76a6704b08093c652fd79-Abstract.html)  [[Code]](https://github.com/vincent-leguen/STRIPE)

         These authors introduce the STRIPE model for representing structured diversity based on shape and time features, ensuring both probable predictions while being sharp and accurate.

## 2021
- Autoformer: Decomposition Transformers with Auto-Correlation for Long-Term Series Forecasting.    [[Paper]](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/bcc0d400288793e8bdcd7c19a8ac0c2b-Abstract.html)  [[Code]](https://github.com/hanlaoshi/Autoformer)

        This paper design Autoformer as a novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. The paper break with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a basic inner block of deep models.
        
- MixSeq: Connecting Macroscopic Time Series Forecasting with Microscopic Time Series Data.  [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14354)

         In this paper, these authors assume that the microscopic time series follow some unknown mixture probabilistic distributions.

- N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437) [[Code]](https://github.com/unit8co/darts)   [[Dataset Used1]](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/m4)  [[Dataset Used2]](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/timehetnet) 

        This paper propose a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully-connected layers. 

## 2018
- Modeling Long- and Short-Term Temporal Patterns with Deep Neural Networks. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07015) [[Code]](https://github.com/laiguokun/LSTNet)

         In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet), to address this open challenge.
